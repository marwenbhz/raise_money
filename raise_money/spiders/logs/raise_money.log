 'Story': u'Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary\n  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai\n  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the\n  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may\n  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai\n  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a\n  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is\n  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for\n  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to\n  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent\n  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually\n  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not\n  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30\xa0years old, Zach has\n  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times\n  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in\n  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work\n  a "normal" job anymore due to complications that arise from\n  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for\n  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share\n  this page with everyone you know. Encourage your loved ones and\n  friends to become an organ and tissue donor. If you have been blessed\n  enough in life to allow yourself to make a donation to this brave,\n  strong young man it is greatly appreciated. All funds raised will be\n  used for basic living and medical expenses for Zach in his time of\n  need. All help is greatly appreciated. Thank you ALL. <3',

A couple of\n  years ago, however, I was diagnosed with arthritis of the hip and this\n  past year I have been using a cane to help me get around. I have a\n  physical therapist who also helps me retain the flexibility, mobility\n  and strength I still have. He told me that the most important thing is\n  just to KEEP MOVING. Therein lies the problem, though, because the hip\n  is a weight bearing joint and walking is painful. As my mobility has\n  decreased, my weight has increased which puts even more strain on the\n  hip. It\'s a vicious cycle. I know what you\'re thinking, "Why not\n  just get a hip replacement?" Believe me, many friends have asked\n  the same question but unfortunately, because of other health issues,\n  surgery is not a viable option for me.',

The option now is to move\n  to the subcutaneous medication which is extremely costly. The medical\n  aid will cover a portion of this every month, but I am short R5000 per\n  month on a 4 week month and R10000 on a 5 week month.\xa0 There is also\n  the cost of a pump to purchase of over R8000 which medical aid does\n  not cover. If I cannot raise enough money, Matthew will not receive\n  the correct amount of medication each month, which could lead to more\n  infections.\xa0 Matthew and I are requesting any form of support no\n  matter how big or small that you can give us to help him lead a normal\n  healthy life.\xa0Thanks to all the local and international kind hearted\n  people matt could start his therapy on his correct level for this\n  month.

During one of our many visits to the beach in Rio De Janeiro,\n  Rafael, my 6 year old son made friends with a little Brazilian girl\n  called Laura, and since then we've got to know her family. So over the\n  last five or six weeks I've been learning about the sad story of\n  Laura's little brother, Bernardo who is 2. He is currently in hospital\n  as a result of a condition called hydrocephalus. This basically means\n  he has an accumulation of spinal fluid on the brain which is causing a\n  very real threat to his health. Since I met his family, he's been in\n  and out of intensive care and has been in hospital for weeks now.\n  Fortunately his mum was able to just about scrape together enough to\n  pay for an operation a short while ago to remove the build up of\n  fluid. Before that Bernardo was at risk of cardiac arrest. However for\n  now, Bernardo is still stuck in the hospital because he hasn't yet had\n  a more permanent solution: a valve installed to remove the excess\n  spinal fluid on his brain as it continues to build up.",

 'Story': u"Hello, my name is Darin John and I am 41 years old. I love my family,\n  and the outdoors. I've worked hard all of my life. My first tax paying\n  job was when I was 12 years old. I have managed to be gainfully\n  employed and take care of my responsibilities since I was 18. Not to\n  say I haven't made a few costly choices along the way but for the most\n  part I have been frugal. I have never owned my own house or had a lot\n  of money but I've managed to stay relatively debt free. I'm proud of\n  that and it is really hard for me to ask for help. So its not for me\n  as much as it is for my family who depends on me. You see in the last\n  6 years I've fallen and broke my back, have gotten carpel tunnel from\n  too much work with pliers, and now have been diagnosed with Adult\n  Growth Hormone Deficiency. Basically my body is not producing the\n  chemical it needs to rebuild itself. Every day I feel more pain,\n  exhaustion, and hopelessness. I feel old and worn and beaten like I'm\n  aging exponentially. Some days I feel it is more than I can bare and\n  it makes me scared for my family. I know I don't have much in me\n  anymore and I know my family can't survive on disability or welfare.\n  With the rising cost of living I see more and more people using these\n  programs becoming homeless. I can't let that happen. The problem is I\n  can't save money faster than things come up to drain the savings like\n  car repairs, kids expenses, medical bills, and high prescription\n  costs, ect. I have a good plan to ensure my family is taken care of\n  but I'm going to need help to make it a reality. I want to build an RV\n  resort and campground. A lot of people are moving into RV's and Tiny\n  Houses in the North West because it is more affordable than renting a\n  2 bedroom apartment. Maintaining it would be a job I could manage even\n  when I feel wiped out. If I could keep just 10 RV pads rented to long\n  term residents, which shouldn't be hard at all, I could supliment my\n  current income. \xa0A couple more and I could meet the rising costs of my\n  own Healthcare. I'm not a greedy man, I don't want to be rich or\n  famous I just need a way to meet my families needs that won't wear me\n  out and speed my physical decline. \xa0I've done quite a bit of research\n  on it and I'm confident in this plan. I feel like my days of hard\n  physical labor are numbered, the clock is ticking and my backs against\n  the wall. I need help soon. \xa0If I can get enough people to donate just\n  a little I can make a down payment. So I humbly ask, PLEASE. If you\n  can spare anything to bless my family and me I will forever be\n  grateful. If you can't help financially could you please like and\n  share this. Spreading the word will help too and would be greatly\n  appreciated. Thank you and bless you all.",

I lost all my hearing on my right side and 90 per\n  cent on my left side. I had to get a Cochlear Implant last August, so\n  I can hear. Menieres disease causes me to lose my balance and\n  dizziness, I have fallen multiple times, breaking my fingers, arm,\n  wrist on several occasions. In 2005, I had to leave my job as a\n  veterinary technician for 18 years due to the disease, In 2012, I was\n  diagnosed with CIDP,\xa0 it's very painful and I'm losing use of my legs,\n  I now use a walker, but will need a wheelchair soon. CIDP has moved to\n  both arms as well as my legs. Its getting difficult to hold or pick up\n  things. I have to get ivig treatments every six weeks, 2 days in a\n  row, soon will be every 4 weeks, they are very expensive, while\n  insurance covers most, co-pays are getting to me. I get social\n  Security disability, my diseases aren't military related to get VA\n  benefits, I do have an honorable discharge and can do go to VA\n  clinics, but getting the treatments I need is hard to get. they send\n  me to outside facilities. My Social Security disability benefits are\n  low and for over 10 years, I struggled to get to the end of the month.\n  After my Cochlear implant surgery and my CIDP getting worse, I just\n  can't make it anymore. I don't have family to depend on except my 83\n  year old mother. I desperately need your help, I'm to the point I\n  don't know what I'm going to do. I go to food bank so I can eat.\n  Please anything will help, if you can't donate, please share so others\n  know. God Bless you all",

I am trying to raise money on\n  behalf of him getting these and surprise him. Then he can see my\n  paintings too!. He is a very good soul and helps many people with pain\n  in alternative medicine, he is kind, giving and gentle and generous\n  and if anyone I know deserves the help it is him. He helped save a\n  friend of mine when he fell from fixing his building, the guy was in\n  rough shape and may not have survived if not found by my friend.',

If you know one thing about him it is that he works his butt off\n  every single say to provide for always his family first. I am the\n  lucky daughter of this man and I am here asking for your help. My dad\n  lost his job in 2016. He put his pride aside and him and my mom came\n  and lived with us. He lost his house, his job and his dog all in one\n  year. Since moving down here he has had ups and downs but still\n  continues to work his butt off. He puts family first and many of you\n  may not be blood family but, you sure felt like you belonged in his\n  house. I need help raising money for these glasses for my dad. I think\n  2018 should be positive for him and to see it in color would help the\n  his outlook on life. He would finally be able to see how beautiful my\n  mothers eyes are, and even the simple things such as green trees.\n  Please help me make my dads future bright and help me make it known to\n  him how much love and support he has in his life.',

We held on to everything and valued it,\n  thinking we might get to use it again later. Well so it happens, we\n  are setting up the nursery and even the overseas move was good to it\n  all. So we would prefer to use the same items again. After doing some\n  research we also found out that some things, including clothes are not\n  being shipped to APO/military addresses for whatever reason which\n  would also make it hard with a Baby Registry. So we decided to go a\n  different route. Instead of a Baby Registry we would like you to be\n  part of our Baby's Stem Cell Freezing. Whatever amount you would have\n  spent on something on a registry just donate it here, preferably with\n  a name so we can create a card and put down all names so he/she will\n  know later who was part of it. Of course we are hoping that it will\n  never come to the point that she/he is in need of the Stem Cells but\n  it sure is a nice thought that if there is the need for it you all\n  were part of saving her/his life. This plan covers freezing for 25\n  years and after that he/she can decide to extend it or not. We have\n  Lina's Stem Cells frozen and we are going to do so for this one but we\n  as said we are thinking it would be a wonderful gift coming from\n  everybody. And the reason why we are calling it Baby, he/she or this\n  one is because our little creation is stubborn already and willing to\n  answer the gender question. Always in the position like on the photo\n  ready to do more somersault. :-)",

 'Story': u"Hey folks, my name is Simon and I have been working as a musician and\n  graphic artist around the world for the past 10 years... I am\n  currently living in Cambodia and up until recently this has been a\n  dream life: travelling; meeting amazing people; learning languages and\n  building bridges through music and art. I like to inspire people with\n  my energy and positivity on and off the stage. Usually it is a tough\n  but rewarding life, as musicians and artists know... it's about\n  finding the next gig! Recently I have had some health issues which\n  caused a collapse for me onstage. After spending a lot of time being\n  misdiagnosed, I finally found a great set of doctors here in the\n  Kingdom of Cambodia, who have their patients best interest at heart.\n  When i could no longer make money by playing music, I used my graphic\n  design to make some side cash, however rainy season has just started\n  here and one of the first victims was my computer. This has left me\n  with no real way of being able to fund myself. Unfortunately now all\n  of this has exhausted all of my funds and I am not in a position to be\n  able to pay for the medical services that I so desperately need. I'm\n  not one to ask for help if I can do things myself, but now I am need\n  of help and that is what I am desperately asking for. I have a stomach\n  ulcer caused by h. pylori infection which after a triple antibiotic\n  treatment doesn't seem to be healing. On top of that I have recurring\n  episodes of tachycardia ( very fast heart beat - 130bpm.) I need to\n  raise about $1000 in total to pay for medical expenses such as\n  upcoming heart tests and an endoscopy to check my stomach, as well as\n  any medication needed. I have been stuck on my back for over 6 months\n  now, and I really am struggling with this as I usually am full of\n  energy and giving time to help others in need. Please, if you can help\n  me at this low part in my life story, it would mean so much to me. My\n  partner Darya is working as hard as she can to provide us both with\n  food, rent and basic medicines.But as it is rainy season now, work\n  isn't as avaiable. I dont really need help to replace my material\n  things, I can use my own energy to do this. But I really need help to\n  get on my feet, get better and get my energy back to replace them. I\n  know that all I need is some medical help and I will be back at it\n  again... that is my natural way. I am a fighter, but sometimes\n  fighters need help - and that is what I am asking for.",

Which I sure a t of you will be saying wow that I a lot of\n  money just for a dog and u know what you are right but if you take the\n  time to read this you might be a bit of a idea of how much this dog\n  can do to improve my little boys life everyday and also our family Now\n  this is going to be a bit of a long story but please read it trough so\n  you can understand how much this means to me, my son and our family. I\n  am going to start with the benefits the dog will provide and then I\n  will tell you what your puppy (due to be born any day now) will be\n  trained in and then I am going to tell you about Ryan and try and give\n  you an incite to what our life is like. Not only that we are in a\n  special place because our puppy is only just about to be born I will\n  be sharing the story with you all from the very start so you will get\n  to hear about all the training that goes into an assistance dog, you\n  will get to watch the bonding sessions with our puppy and Ryan all the\n  way till the day he or she comes home. An assistance dog is trained\n  for the needs of each person and just like a guide dog will go\n  everywhere with us, they even wear one of those cute little blue\n  jackets. First and foremost, they are considered \u201cservice\u201d dogs. the\n  mission of these animals is to increase the safety of the person with\n  autism. For example, such a dog may lower the likelihood of the person\n  bolting or crossing a busy street, because it is physically connected\n  to the person with autism. The dogs are trained to follow commands\n  from parents, stop at doorways, and resist the child moving away by\n  using its weight to slow or stop the child The dogs provide a constant\n  partner and companion that the child can bond with. In most cases, the\n  dog sleeps with the child, allowing for less panic attacks from the\n  child and resulting in a more restful nights\u2019 sleep. When working in\n  public, most children are tethered to the dog, acting as an anchor for\n  a child who may bolt or run away when over-stimulated. The dogs are\n  trained to become a canine version of a weighted sensory blanket to\n  help the child when the inevitable meltdown occurs. Some nonverbal\n  clients have started to speak to the dog or tell others about their\n  dog. They also help the child with social activities There are many\n  benefits - these are just a few. Each Custom Canine is specifically\n  trained to enhance the unique needs of the child and household in\n  which they are placed. Some of the things our puppy will be trained\n  with are listed below, the other thing you need to understand after\n  our puppy comes home his or her training wont stop as Ryan gets older\n  his needs will change and so the dog will be trained in those areas to\n  help assist Ryan. Targeted skill \u2013 Responding to meltdown Targeted\n  Skill \u2013 Deep Pressure Therapy Targeted Skill \u2013 distracting games and\n  rough play Targeted Skills \u2013 block and cover, for road crossings and\n  approach of people in public places Targeted Skill \u2013 Alert to leaving\n  an area alone Targeted Skill \u2013 locating individual, tracking Targeted\n  Skills \u2013 attending therapies and hospital/Dr. visits So, those are\n  just some of the things our puppy will be trained in. And now the most\n  important part an incite to Ryan and a bit about my little man. A lot\n  of you will look at my little man Ryan and say wow really, he looks\n  like any other little boy. And he does look like any other little boy,\n  you see like most things we all have in our minds how something should\n  look or how it is and I am sure a lot of you when you think of Autism\n  (ASD) you think of a child that doesn\u2019t walk or talk and sits in a\n  corner rock or flapping their arms and this is the case for some\n  children with ASD or on the spectrum. But like most things there are\n  different variants and everyone will sit on the spectrum at a\n  different level. For children on the spectrum they all share social\n  and communication delays as well as restricted and repetitive\n  interests the severity of these problems and the impact on a person\n  life can very considerably. Some children will avoid eye contact while\n  others will smile and hug. Some will have learning difficulties,\n  others will top their class. Some will never speak, where others will\n  display impressive vocabularies, some will flap their hands and rock\n  other will blend without any sign of their condition. What all these\n  children do have in common however is a different way of thinking- a\n  way of thinking which can make the everyday task of socializing and\n  communication very very difficult. Now for Ryan he is classed as high\n  function he can walk and talk but his fine motor skills are behind\n  more like that of a 3 year not a 6-year-old, give him math\u2019s or\n  building and he\u2019s is a wiz but can\u2019t read or write. He doesn\u2019t\n  understand social situations and has no empathy at all and his sensory\n  are all over the place. For example, if Ryan gets the smallest of cuts\n  or bumps it is the end of the world but he will haply jump of the side\n  of our water slide like its nothing, to give u an idea of height I am\n  5.4 and its taller then me. Another thing with Ryan is he hates change\n  or anything new and doesn\u2019t cope so when he need to start school this\n  year it was not a lot of fun for me, we get to the school and out of\n  the car and Ryan and I played cat and mouse for about 10 minutes\n  before I could grab him by this stage I was in tears begging him to\n  please just come and see what school was like and the hardest part for\n  me wasn\u2019t the cat and mouse game it was when I stood there crying\n  begging him to help me he looked straight through me like I wasn\u2019t\n  there. He couldn\u2019t understand why I was so upset. On his second day of\n  school he had a meltdown one of the biggest he has ever had, when I\n  got to the school everyone was out side and his teacher came up to me\n  and said \u201cBec he is ok but we have had to restrain him so he didn\u2019t\n  hurt himself\u201d I was like oh no what has he done. I walked into his\n  classroom and the easiest way to tell you is it looked like the class\n  room had been ransacked, tables and chairs turned upside down, books\n  all over the floor and here is Ryan sitting on the floor with his\n  principle and she had her arms wrapped around him (not hard or in a\n  bad way) to stop him. I took one look at him and then the room and\n  bust into tears. Ryan looked at me and said \u201cmummy why is you crying\u201d\n  I wanted to scream are u Fxxxing kidding me. It was only days later\n  when I was talking to his teacher and she said when Ryan asked me why\n  I was crying the look on his face she said he had no idea and don\u2019t\n  understand what he had done and why it would upset me. You Ryan is\n  such a sweet little boy but life isn\u2019t easy for Ryan what he\u2019s see and\n  hears is so different to us, there are days where he will say nothing\n  to me but poo poo head or when he\u2019s is playing cars they all must be\n  lined up in a row before you can play. Ask him about dinosaurs and he\n  can tell you things that you would be like where did you learn that or\n  how did he know that. But playing with friends is hard well he doesn\u2019t\n  really have any as he doesn\u2019t know when something is game or when\n  people have had enough as he can\u2019t read our face like most people do\n  to know if your angry or sad. It all about Ryan a lot say tunnel\n  vision he only sees his way and that is that. Then there is going to\n  the shops with Ryan or out in general with Ryan is just hell on wheels\n  and I try and not go out with him, for most of you that saw us at the\n  supermarket you would think he was just a naughty little boy that I\n  couldn\u2019t control. He normally runs away or runs up and down all the\n  isle saying things like poo poo head or he runs away or he hides but\n  you see for him its to much going on and this sends his brain and\n  sensory into overload and all the noise, colour and people keep\n  rushing and he doesn\u2019t know how to process this. For you to understand\n  what this may be like I want you to close your eyes and remember the\n  first time you walk into a night club the people the loud music all\n  the lights glass breaking and it takes you a few minutes to adjust and\n  your all good and go have a drink or a dance well for Ryan that first\n  few minutes doesn\u2019t stop it keeps going getting worse and worse the\n  longer he is there and he doesn\u2019t know how to regulate it and turn it\n  off. These are just some of the things that Ryan struggles with in\n  everyday life, I could go on to tell you about feeding him and all I\n  will say is he eats very little and it must be white except for Icey\n  poles give him a white one of those and he will look at you like your\n  silly. Now Ryan also has 2 sisters Emma 7 and Grace 2 and they go\n  through a lot with him, he hits them and sometimes with his oldest\n  Emma she wants some here time and he just doesn\u2019t understand give her\n  some space and just keeps asking her to play. So, this assistance dog\n  will not only help Ryan with his safety (and yes, he has run out onto\n  the road in main traffic) social skills and help with his meltdowns\n  but help us as a family. We could go out as a family and know Ryan is\n  safe and if he has a meltdown an extra pair of paws I guess would be\n  the right words. So please help me raise funds for Ryan and help with\n  awareness for autism and assistance dogs. Any help big or small would\n  be so much help and mean more then you will ever know. Please share my\n  page to anyone you think can help and keep your eye on this page as I\n  will add my blog and Facebook page as soon as I have set it all up so\n  you can watch our magical story come to life.',

 'Story': u'My Mom is Michelle McClurg & I\'m her 16yr Old Son Travis McClurg\n  Trying To Do A Fundraiser For My Mom. She has now had 11 surgeries\n  since March 2014. My mom has had Cervical Cancer, Breast Cancer, Lumps\n  in her knee that had to be removed & a Lump in her Stomach which\n  has caused many other health issues. She still has lumps in her jaw,\n  cheek, left side behind her ribs, one in her left nostril, she has\n  lumps going all down her esophagus, throat, tonsils, back of her\n  tongue & on each side. ( they believe that\'s why she has a new\n  large mass in her stomach now) My mother now has Gastroparesis which\n  is very rare & very painful there is not a lot of information\n  about it & there is no cure! My Mom had to have a special test\n  where they had her eat One microwaved scrambled egg with radiation on\n  it then they put her in a radiation machine that followed the dye\n  that\'s on the scrambled egg. She was in there for six hours then they\n  gave her a two hour break then they put her back in the machine for\n  another two hours. The results were that after eight\xa0hours of being in\n  the machine & a two hour break only 8% of that ONE scrambled egg\n  digested which means my mom\'s GI Track is paralyzed /shut down from\n  her esophagus to her anus. She lost 60lbs in one month & they told\n  her that there was nothing more that they were able to do for her.\n  That wasn\'t good enough for my mom so she called every doctor she ever\n  met, saw or talked too & even other doctors that knew other\n  doctors tried to come with ideas to help my mom due to how severe she\n  is, there were little to no options left for her. They came up with a\n  G & J Tube that the hoses comes out of her left side of her\n  stomach it\'s NOT a Feeding Tube. The J Tube is located on the left\n  side of her near her Pancreas going into the intestine that puts the\n  nutrients in & flushes with water every two hours. It gets clogged\n  a lot & we have had many problems with both hoses that are\n  available the two company\'s should get together & take the good\n  parts from the one & the good parts from the other due to neither\n  of them work that great. The G tube hose is connected to her esophagus\n  with a "tree connector" that\'s what connects the J Tube\n  & cavity that\'s connected to a bag where all the bio, skin, blood,\n  any clear liquid she drinks to wet her mouth to keep it moist &\n  any ice cream she may sneak in once at night cause it can go down the\n  hose but even that has made her throw up & that\'s not something\n  you see everyday due to anything she throws up is what is in the waste\n  bag cause she doesn\'t eat or drink. She started getting sick again\n  here & there almost a month ago but we\'ve learned how to quickly\n  get the nausea taken care of at times it works & sometimes it\n  don\'t. They only give you one waste bag once a month so I have to\n  clean it & trust me, who ever came up with that rule at the\n  insurance company if they came here & emptied the waste bag ONCE\n  they would give you a lot more. We have had bags break, get leaks in\n  the weirdest places, my mom passes out a lot & there are times she\n  has almost pulled the hose right out of her stomach. Her memory has\n  gotten really bad to the point she doesn\'t remember watching a movie,\n  talking in a conversation or even sometimes she has even forgotten the\n  whole day. She has had lumps appear on her her head but hasn\'t fallen\n  & has done nothing to cause the lumps. She gets migraines almost\n  everyday now along with bloody noises, sensitivity to the light or\n  sound. Put it this way she is not the Michelle we all love & know.\n  I do all her IV bage which are just nutrients to give her what she\n  needs & keep her alive along with water. The IV gets changed\n  everyday plus her commode has to be emptied two to three times a day\n  cause she has lost almost all her muscle & has very little energy\n  to be able to get to the bathroom by herself safely. She has a\n  wheelchair for when we need to go to the hospital but if we are not\n  going to a doctor or hospital my mom has to stay home in bed 24/7.\n  She\'s to weak to do things & time to time she gets a little rush\n  then over does it then pays for it. Now with me being back to school\n  they allow me to drive & have my phone with me during school but I\n  worry about her all day cause I make sure she has her meds close by\n  plus other things to help her through the day but we don\'t have any\n  family close by that can help & we have a few friends that do\n  stuff here & there but they have their own lives, get busy, &\n  just run out of time. We are not eligible for any government programs\n  due to my mom worked hard, ( she feels like she\'s being punished by\n  the government for paying taxes, having a good job, college &\n  staying off of welfare) made sure she had long term disability but\n  what they didn\'t tell her it wouldn\'t be enough & just enough to\n  be NOT eligible for Medicad & other programs that could help us\n  now cause you can\'t make over $800 a month. We have cut back on\n  everything obviously the first thing is food, then cable, electric,\n  gas things we need but then go with out & it\'s still not helping.\n  The bills are getting more & more piled up? The medical bills have\n  to sit in a pile behind the Must Pay Bills! My mom taught me how to do\n  the bills cause she has gotten so sick now that just getting up to pay\n  a bill is a lot for her. I try to do physical therapy everyday but\n  lately it just doesn\'t seem like there is not enough time in the day\n  to do everything, there are times we don\'t get done until 1a. On a\n  school night. My mom has other health problems from being so sick\n  & the result of getting Cancer. She has Sj\xf6gren\'s Syndrome which\n  is a Auto immune deficiency that\xa0effects her eyes by giving her dry\n  eyes then gets horrible nerve pain in her Jaw, chin & teeth. She\n  told me it feels like her jaw is broke & someone is ripping\xa0her\n  teeth out with pliers! It took two weeks for the medication to kick in\n  plus it costs $189 a month & they explained to my mom after she\n  told them it was to expensive for her to pay that\'s the best one for\n  her to be one due to how severe it is. The prescriptions each month\n  are outrageous & there have been times lately that my mom hasn\'t\n  been able to get some of her MEDS due to we don\'t have the money for\n  it. She also has severe fibromyalgia that is constinatly flared up due\n  to her body not being able to rest, heal or not be so stressed out\n  worrying about everything. We had a nursing staff but it\'s no longer\n  available due to our health care policy & they told her she would\n  have to pay independently. She had nurses aids that would help her get\n  dressed, take a shower, brush her teeth or just anything else she\n  needed done for her or the house now we don\'t have that so its created\n  more stress on the both of us. \xa0I have watched my mom over the years\n  help so many people, do things that people don\'t even know about &\n  she would always tell me that if you brag it wasn\'t done with good\n  intensions, you did it cause you felt inside that you needed to help\n  this person or thing. Well that\'s what we are asking for Not Charity\n  we need people with good intentions cause if there ever was a time my\n  mom needed help it\'s now.',

My job went\n  from full time to part tI me to minimal to nothing...and I just kept\n  getting sicker. First I had flu like symptoms a super stiff\n  neck..chronic fatigue \xa0and severe shoulder blade pain and weakness. I\n  couldn't turn my neck I could hardly walk low energy felt I was going\n  to faint and had heavy heart palpitations. Then it moved to my\n  reproductive system and much pain and many cysts appeared. .and they\n  found an adnexal cyst which the doc thought could be cancerous so I\n  had it removed and it wasn't thank god.we thought. Then my blood was\n  affected low iron needing iron iv for 2 yrs at the RGH.

It has given us Hope. However, it got me thinking,\n  what would of happened if my family weren't able to\xa0support the\n  treatment financially? What happens to the people that don't have this\n  type of support or knowledge? Do they just give up and accept nothing\n  can be done?",
