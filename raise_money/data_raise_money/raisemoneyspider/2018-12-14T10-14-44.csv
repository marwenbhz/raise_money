"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for
  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share
  this page with everyone you know. Encourage your loved ones and

"Hello, my name is Darin John and I am 41 years old. I love my family,
  and the outdoors. I've worked hard all of my life. My first tax paying
  job was when I was 12 years old. I have managed to be gainfully
  employed and take care of my responsibilities since I was 18. Not to
  say I haven't made a few costly choices along the way but for the most
  part I have been frugal. I have never owned my own house or had a lot
  of money but I've managed to stay relatively debt free. I'm proud of
  that and it is really hard for me to ask for help. So its not for me
  as much as it is for my family who depends on me. You see in the last
  6 years I've fallen and broke my back, have gotten carpel tunnel from
  too much work with pliers, and now have been diagnosed with Adult
  Growth Hormone Deficiency. Basically my body is not producing the
  chemical it needs to rebuild itself. Every day I feel more pain,
  exhaustion, and hopelessness. I feel old and worn and beaten like I'm
  aging exponentially. Some days I feel it is more than I can bare and
  it makes me scared for my family. I know I don't have much in me
  anymore and I know my family can't survive on disability or welfare.
  With the rising cost of living I see more and more people using these
  programs becoming homeless. I can't let that happen. The problem is I
  can't save money faster than things come up to drain the savings like
  car repairs, kids expenses, medical bills, and high prescription
  costs, ect. I have a good plan to ensure my family is taken care of
  but I'm going to need help to make it a reality. I want to build an RV
  resort and campground. A lot of people are moving into RV's and Tiny
  Houses in the North West because it is more affordable than renting a
  2 bedroom apartment. Maintaining it would be a job I could manage even
  when I feel wiped out. If I could keep just 10 RV pads rented to long
  term residents, which shouldn't be hard at all, I could supliment my
  current income.  A couple more and I could meet the rising costs of my
  own Healthcare. I'm not a greedy man, I don't want to be rich or
  famous I just need a way to meet my families needs that won't wear me
  out and speed my physical decline.  I've done quite a bit of research
  on it and I'm confident in this plan. I feel like my days of hard
  physical labor are numbered, the clock is ticking and my backs against
  the wall. I need help soon.  If I can get enough people to donate just
  a little I can make a down payment. So I humbly ask, PLEASE. If you
  can spare anything to bless my family and me I will forever be
  grateful. If you can't help financially could you please like and
  share this. Spreading the word will help too and would be greatly
  appreciated. Thank you and bless you all.",I'm Darin John and I have recently been diagnosed with AGHD. Basically my body is not rebuilding itself.

"This time we would like to do something different. As most of you
  know and used it, we had a Baby Registry for Lina and we received
  wonderful items for her. We held on to everything and valued it,
  thinking we might get to use it again later. Well so it happens, we
  are setting up the nursery and even the overseas move was good to it
  all. So we would prefer to use the same items again. After doing some
  research we also found out that some things, including clothes are not
  being shipped to APO/military addresses for whatever reason which
  would also make it hard with a Baby Registry. So we decided to go a
  different route. Instead of a Baby Registry we would like you to be
  part of our Baby's Stem Cell Freezing. Whatever amount you would have
  spent on something on a registry just donate it here, preferably with
  a name so we can create a card and put down all names so he/she will
  know later who was part of it. Of course we are hoping that it will
  never come to the point that she/he is in need of the Stem Cells but
  it sure is a nice thought that if there is the need for it you all
  were part of saving her/his life. This plan covers freezing for 25
  years and after that he/she can decide to extend it or not. We have
  Lina's Stem Cells frozen and we are going to do so for this one but we
  as said we are thinking it would be a wonderful gift coming from

"Hey folks, my name is Simon and I have been working as a musician and
  graphic artist around the world for the past 10 years... I am
  currently living in Cambodia and up until recently this has been a
  dream life: travelling; meeting amazing people; learning languages and
  building bridges through music and art. I like to inspire people with
  my energy and positivity on and off the stage. Usually it is a tough
  but rewarding life, as musicians and artists know... it's about
  finding the next gig! Recently I have had some health issues which
  caused a collapse for me onstage. After spending a lot of time being
  misdiagnosed, I finally found a great set of doctors here in the
  Kingdom of Cambodia, who have their patients best interest at heart.
  When i could no longer make money by playing music, I used my graphic
  design to make some side cash, however rainy season has just started
  here and one of the first victims was my computer. This has left me
  with no real way of being able to fund myself. Unfortunately now all
  of this has exhausted all of my funds and I am not in a position to be
  able to pay for the medical services that I so desperately need. I'm
  not one to ask for help if I can do things myself, but now I am need
  of help and that is what I am desperately asking for. I have a stomach
  ulcer caused by h. pylori infection which after a triple antibiotic
  treatment doesn't seem to be healing. On top of that I have recurring
  episodes of tachycardia ( very fast heart beat - 130bpm.) I need to
  raise about $1000 in total to pay for medical expenses such as
  upcoming heart tests and an endoscopy to check my stomach, as well as
  any medication needed. I have been stuck on my back for over 6 months
  now, and I really am struggling with this as I usually am full of
  energy and giving time to help others in need. Please, if you can help
  me at this low part in my life story, it would mean so much to me. My
  partner Darya is working as hard as she can to provide us both with
  food, rent and basic medicines.But as it is rainy season now, work
  isn't as avaiable. I dont really need help to replace my material
  things, I can use my own energy to do this. But I really need help to
  get on my feet, get better and get my energy back to replace them. I
  know that all I need is some medical help and I will be back at it
  again... that is my natural way. I am a fighter, but sometimes

"I am needing to raise $26552 for my little boy to get assistant dog
  for autism. Which I sure a t of you will be saying wow that I a lot of
  money just for a dog and u know what you are right but if you take the
  time to read this you might be a bit of a idea of how much this dog
  can do to improve my little boys life everyday and also our family Now
  this is going to be a bit of a long story but please read it trough so
  you can understand how much this means to me, my son and our family. I
  am going to start with the benefits the dog will provide and then I
  will tell you what your puppy (due to be born any day now) will be
  trained in and then I am going to tell you about Ryan and try and give
  you an incite to what our life is like. Not only that we are in a
  special place because our puppy is only just about to be born I will
  be sharing the story with you all from the very start so you will get
  to hear about all the training that goes into an assistance dog, you
  will get to watch the bonding sessions with our puppy and Ryan all the
  way till the day he or she comes home. An assistance dog is trained
  for the needs of each person and just like a guide dog will go
  everywhere with us, they even wear one of those cute little blue
  jackets. First and foremost, they are considered “service” dogs. the
  mission of these animals is to increase the safety of the person with
  autism. For example, such a dog may lower the likelihood of the person
  bolting or crossing a busy street, because it is physically connected
  to the person with autism. The dogs are trained to follow commands
  from parents, stop at doorways, and resist the child moving away by
  using its weight to slow or stop the child The dogs provide a constant
  partner and companion that the child can bond with. In most cases, the
  dog sleeps with the child, allowing for less panic attacks from the
  child and resulting in a more restful nights’ sleep. When working in
  public, most children are tethered to the dog, acting as an anchor for
  a child who may bolt or run away when over-stimulated. The dogs are
  trained to become a canine version of a weighted sensory blanket to
  help the child when the inevitable meltdown occurs. Some nonverbal
  clients have started to speak to the dog or tell others about their
  dog. They also help the child with social activities There are many
  benefits - these are just a few. Each Custom Canine is specifically
  trained to enhance the unique needs of the child and household in
  which they are placed. Some of the things our puppy will be trained
  with are listed below, the other thing you need to understand after
  our puppy comes home his or her training wont stop as Ryan gets older
  his needs will change and so the dog will be trained in those areas to
  help assist Ryan. Targeted skill – Responding to meltdown Targeted
  Skill – Deep Pressure Therapy Targeted Skill – distracting games and
  rough play Targeted Skills – block and cover, for road crossings and
  approach of people in public places Targeted Skill – Alert to leaving
  an area alone Targeted Skill – locating individual, tracking Targeted
  Skills – attending therapies and hospital/Dr. visits So, those are
  just some of the things our puppy will be trained in. And now the most
  important part an incite to Ryan and a bit about my little man. A lot
  of you will look at my little man Ryan and say wow really, he looks
  like any other little boy. And he does look like any other little boy,
  you see like most things we all have in our minds how something should
  look or how it is and I am sure a lot of you when you think of Autism
  (ASD) you think of a child that doesn’t walk or talk and sits in a
  corner rock or flapping their arms and this is the case for some
  children with ASD or on the spectrum. But like most things there are
  different variants and everyone will sit on the spectrum at a
  different level. For children on the spectrum they all share social
  and communication delays as well as restricted and repetitive
  interests the severity of these problems and the impact on a person
  life can very considerably. Some children will avoid eye contact while
  others will smile and hug. Some will have learning difficulties,
  others will top their class. Some will never speak, where others will
  display impressive vocabularies, some will flap their hands and rock
  other will blend without any sign of their condition. What all these
  children do have in common however is a different way of thinking- a
  way of thinking which can make the everyday task of socializing and
  communication very very difficult. Now for Ryan he is classed as high
  function he can walk and talk but his fine motor skills are behind
  more like that of a 3 year not a 6-year-old, give him math’s or
  building and he’s is a wiz but can’t read or write. He doesn’t
  understand social situations and has no empathy at all and his sensory
  are all over the place. For example, if Ryan gets the smallest of cuts
  or bumps it is the end of the world but he will haply jump of the side
  of our water slide like its nothing, to give u an idea of height I am
  5.4 and its taller then me. Another thing with Ryan is he hates change
  or anything new and doesn’t cope so when he need to start school this
  year it was not a lot of fun for me, we get to the school and out of
  the car and Ryan and I played cat and mouse for about 10 minutes
  before I could grab him by this stage I was in tears begging him to
  please just come and see what school was like and the hardest part for
  me wasn’t the cat and mouse game it was when I stood there crying
  begging him to help me he looked straight through me like I wasn’t
  there. He couldn’t understand why I was so upset. On his second day of
  school he had a meltdown one of the biggest he has ever had, when I
  got to the school everyone was out side and his teacher came up to me
  and said “Bec he is ok but we have had to restrain him so he didn’t
  hurt himself” I was like oh no what has he done. I walked into his
  classroom and the easiest way to tell you is it looked like the class
  room had been ransacked, tables and chairs turned upside down, books
  all over the floor and here is Ryan sitting on the floor with his
  principle and she had her arms wrapped around him (not hard or in a
  bad way) to stop him. I took one look at him and then the room and
  bust into tears. Ryan looked at me and said “mummy why is you crying”
  I wanted to scream are u Fxxxing kidding me. It was only days later
  when I was talking to his teacher and she said when Ryan asked me why
  I was crying the look on his face she said he had no idea and don’t
  understand what he had done and why it would upset me. You Ryan is
  such a sweet little boy but life isn’t easy for Ryan what he’s see and
  hears is so different to us, there are days where he will say nothing
  to me but poo poo head or when he’s is playing cars they all must be
  lined up in a row before you can play. Ask him about dinosaurs and he
  can tell you things that you would be like where did you learn that or
  how did he know that. But playing with friends is hard well he doesn’t
  really have any as he doesn’t know when something is game or when
  people have had enough as he can’t read our face like most people do
  to know if your angry or sad. It all about Ryan a lot say tunnel
  vision he only sees his way and that is that. Then there is going to
  the shops with Ryan or out in general with Ryan is just hell on wheels
  and I try and not go out with him, for most of you that saw us at the
  supermarket you would think he was just a naughty little boy that I
  couldn’t control. He normally runs away or runs up and down all the
  isle saying things like poo poo head or he runs away or he hides but
  you see for him its to much going on and this sends his brain and
  sensory into overload and all the noise, colour and people keep
  rushing and he doesn’t know how to process this. For you to understand
  what this may be like I want you to close your eyes and remember the
  first time you walk into a night club the people the loud music all
  the lights glass breaking and it takes you a few minutes to adjust and
  your all good and go have a drink or a dance well for Ryan that first
  few minutes doesn’t stop it keeps going getting worse and worse the
  longer he is there and he doesn’t know how to regulate it and turn it
  off. These are just some of the things that Ryan struggles with in
  everyday life, I could go on to tell you about feeding him and all I
  will say is he eats very little and it must be white except for Icey
  poles give him a white one of those and he will look at you like your
  silly. Now Ryan also has 2 sisters Emma 7 and Grace 2 and they go
  through a lot with him, he hits them and sometimes with his oldest
  Emma she wants some here time and he just doesn’t understand give her
  some space and just keeps asking her to play. So, this assistance dog
  will not only help Ryan with his safety (and yes, he has run out onto
  the road in main traffic) social skills and help with his meltdowns
  but help us as a family. We could go out as a family and know Ryan is
  safe and if he has a meltdown an extra pair of paws I guess would be
  the right words. So please help me raise funds for Ryan and help with
  awareness for autism and assistance dogs. Any help big or small would
  be so much help and mean more then you will ever know. Please share my

"My Mom is Michelle McClurg & I'm her 16yr Old Son Travis McClurg
  Trying To Do A Fundraiser For My Mom. She has now had 11 surgeries
  since March 2014. My mom has had Cervical Cancer, Breast Cancer, Lumps
  in her knee that had to be removed & a Lump in her Stomach which
  has caused many other health issues. She still has lumps in her jaw,
  cheek, left side behind her ribs, one in her left nostril, she has
  lumps going all down her esophagus, throat, tonsils, back of her
  tongue & on each side. ( they believe that's why she has a new
  large mass in her stomach now) My mother now has Gastroparesis which
  is very rare & very painful there is not a lot of information
  about it & there is no cure! My Mom had to have a special test
  where they had her eat One microwaved scrambled egg with radiation on
  it then they put her in a radiation machine that followed the dye
  that's on the scrambled egg. She was in there for six hours then they
  gave her a two hour break then they put her back in the machine for
  another two hours. The results were that after eight hours of being in
  the machine & a two hour break only 8% of that ONE scrambled egg
  digested which means my mom's GI Track is paralyzed /shut down from
  her esophagus to her anus. She lost 60lbs in one month & they told
  her that there was nothing more that they were able to do for her.
  That wasn't good enough for my mom so she called every doctor she ever
  met, saw or talked too & even other doctors that knew other
  doctors tried to come with ideas to help my mom due to how severe she
  is, there were little to no options left for her. They came up with a
  G & J Tube that the hoses comes out of her left side of her
  stomach it's NOT a Feeding Tube. The J Tube is located on the left
  side of her near her Pancreas going into the intestine that puts the
  nutrients in & flushes with water every two hours. It gets clogged
  a lot & we have had many problems with both hoses that are
  available the two company's should get together & take the good
  parts from the one & the good parts from the other due to neither
  of them work that great. The G tube hose is connected to her esophagus
  with a ""tree connector"" that's what connects the J Tube
  & cavity that's connected to a bag where all the bio, skin, blood,
  any clear liquid she drinks to wet her mouth to keep it moist &
  any ice cream she may sneak in once at night cause it can go down the
  hose but even that has made her throw up & that's not something
  you see everyday due to anything she throws up is what is in the waste
  bag cause she doesn't eat or drink. She started getting sick again
  here & there almost a month ago but we've learned how to quickly
  get the nausea taken care of at times it works & sometimes it
  don't. They only give you one waste bag once a month so I have to
  clean it & trust me, who ever came up with that rule at the
  insurance company if they came here & emptied the waste bag ONCE
  they would give you a lot more. We have had bags break, get leaks in
  the weirdest places, my mom passes out a lot & there are times she
  has almost pulled the hose right out of her stomach. Her memory has
  gotten really bad to the point she doesn't remember watching a movie,
  talking in a conversation or even sometimes she has even forgotten the
  whole day. She has had lumps appear on her her head but hasn't fallen
  & has done nothing to cause the lumps. She gets migraines almost
  everyday now along with bloody noises, sensitivity to the light or
  sound. Put it this way she is not the Michelle we all love & know.
  I do all her IV bage which are just nutrients to give her what she
  needs & keep her alive along with water. The IV gets changed
  everyday plus her commode has to be emptied two to three times a day
  cause she has lost almost all her muscle & has very little energy
  to be able to get to the bathroom by herself safely. She has a
  wheelchair for when we need to go to the hospital but if we are not
  going to a doctor or hospital my mom has to stay home in bed 24/7.
  She's to weak to do things & time to time she gets a little rush
  then over does it then pays for it. Now with me being back to school
  they allow me to drive & have my phone with me during school but I
  worry about her all day cause I make sure she has her meds close by
  plus other things to help her through the day but we don't have any
  family close by that can help & we have a few friends that do
  stuff here & there but they have their own lives, get busy, &
  just run out of time. We are not eligible for any government programs
  due to my mom worked hard, ( she feels like she's being punished by
  the government for paying taxes, having a good job, college &
  staying off of welfare) made sure she had long term disability but
  what they didn't tell her it wouldn't be enough & just enough to
  be NOT eligible for Medicad & other programs that could help us
  now cause you can't make over $800 a month. We have cut back on
  everything obviously the first thing is food, then cable, electric,
  gas things we need but then go with out & it's still not helping.
  The bills are getting more & more piled up? The medical bills have
  to sit in a pile behind the Must Pay Bills! My mom taught me how to do
  the bills cause she has gotten so sick now that just getting up to pay
  a bill is a lot for her. I try to do physical therapy everyday but
  lately it just doesn't seem like there is not enough time in the day
  to do everything, there are times we don't get done until 1a. On a
  school night. My mom has other health problems from being so sick
  & the result of getting Cancer. She has Sjögren's Syndrome which
  is a Auto immune deficiency that effects her eyes by giving her dry
  eyes then gets horrible nerve pain in her Jaw, chin & teeth. She
  told me it feels like her jaw is broke & someone is ripping her
  teeth out with pliers! It took two weeks for the medication to kick in
  plus it costs $189 a month & they explained to my mom after she
  told them it was to expensive for her to pay that's the best one for
  her to be one due to how severe it is. The prescriptions each month
  are outrageous & there have been times lately that my mom hasn't
  been able to get some of her MEDS due to we don't have the money for
  it. She also has severe fibromyalgia that is constinatly flared up due
  to her body not being able to rest, heal or not be so stressed out
  worrying about everything. We had a nursing staff but it's no longer
  available due to our health care policy & they told her she would
  have to pay independently. She had nurses aids that would help her get
  dressed, take a shower, brush her teeth or just anything else she
  needed done for her or the house now we don't have that so its created
  more stress on the both of us.  I have watched my mom over the years
  help so many people, do things that people don't even know about &
  she would always tell me that if you brag it wasn't done with good
  intensions, you did it cause you felt inside that you needed to help
  this person or thing. Well that's what we are asking for Not Charity
  we need people with good intentions cause if there ever was a time my
  mom needed help it's now.","Michelle McClurg, My mother has had Breast Cancer along with her Stomach plus Her GI Track shut down,this is called gastroparesis which is extremely rare.

"For those of you who don't know my mums story, it begins when she was
  diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in January 2015. She has
  since completed a course of treatment which included 9 cycles of
  grueling chemotherapy and a life-threatening operation, all with the
  courage and grace of what can only be described as superhero worthy!
  Her spirit and fight for life has never waived, not once, even when we
  received the news no one ever wants to hear.  'We are very sorry,
  there are no further treatments available ' - upon hearing those
  words, the world around you seems to stand still, a second becomes
  like a minute, a minute feels like an hour,  and you are only aware of
  the hand you are holding tightly next to you. What do we do next? How
  do we just accept that? She wants to fight - That's when my best
  friend introduced me to LOVE, HOPE,TRUST, a truly amazing charity
  founded by Rachel Carrick, who herself has been in mum's shoes.
  Without this Trust we would of never found Cancer Options who have
  provided invaluable guidance on the treatment options available
  outside the NHS. It has given us Hope. However, it got me thinking,
  what would of happened if my family weren't able to support the
  treatment financially? What happens to the people that don't have this
  type of support or knowledge? Do they just give up and accept nothing
  can be done?","In my inspirational mum's memory,  I wish to raise money for a small charity who has shown us the true meaning of HOPE-  its the little voice that whispers 'maybe' when the rest of the world is screaming 'no'",Claire-Anne Lytton,110,"LOVE, HOPE, TRUST","3,100£",https://fundrazr.com/018C97,"Newcastle Upon Tyne, GB",103%

  cannot walk, and some days I cannot see. I am only 31 years old, but I
  feel like I am much older as the flares cause terrible bone pain and
